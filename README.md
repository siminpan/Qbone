# Qbone

The `Qbone` package is a set of tools that enables efficient
estimation of quantlets in quantile functional regression to analyze distributional data.
This package can be used to analyze distributional data in broader applications such as climate change analysis, image recognition analysis, and personalized health data analysis, etc. 


## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("siminpan/Qbone")
```

## Acknowledgment

This is my first R package. "R packages" by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan and "Advanced R", a book in Chapman & Hall's R Series, both taught me a lot.
The structure of my package is heavily influenced by Seurat and SeuratObject.
