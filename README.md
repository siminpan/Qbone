# Qbone

The `Qbone` package is a set of tools that enables efficient
estimation of quantlets in quantile functional regression to analyze distributional data. <br />
This package can be used to analyze distributional data in broader applications such as climate change analysis, image recognition analysis, and personalized health data analysis, etc. 


## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
