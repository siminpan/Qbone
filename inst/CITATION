Abstract:
Background
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy. Chemotherapy plays an essential role in OS treatment, potentially doubling 5-year event-free survival if tumour necrosis can be stimulated. The canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) enhances OS survival in part through upregulation of aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1A1 which neutralises reactive oxygen species originating from nutritional stress and chemotherapeutic challenge.

Methods
A vivo morpholino (DkkMo) was employed to block the expression of Dkk-1 in OS cells. Cell mitosis, gene expression and bone destruction were measured in vitro and in vivo in the presence and absence of doxorubicin (DRB).

Results
DkkMo reduced the expression of Dkk-1 and Aldh1a1, reduced expansion of OS tumours, preserved bone volume and architecture and stimulated tumour necrosis. This was observed in the presence or absence of DRB.

Conclusion
These results indicate that administration of DkkMo with or without chemotherapeutics can substantially improve OS outcome with respect to tumour expansion and osteolytic corruption of bone in experimental OS model.
